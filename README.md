# Mixmax-BreweryDB v1.0
Mixmax link resolver that will give some information regarding a brewerydb.com/beer beer

It uses HTTPS, so you'll need to generate a key and cert (server.key and server.cert respectively) and put them in the base package. I used http://www.selfsignedcertificate.com/ for generating my cert.

## Running locally

1. Install using `npm install`
2. Run using `npm start`

##Using Mixmax-BreweryDB
